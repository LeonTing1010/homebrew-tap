  # `brew install LeonTing1010/tap/tap` (the original install command in
  # docs / blog posts / user terminals) must continue to resolve. Per
  # ADR `2026-05-09-userspace-via-standards.md` Tier 0: install command
  # strings frozen by user keystroke; rename = userspace break unless
  # the old name keeps resolving. The rename `tap → taprun` is declared
  # in the tap-level `formula_renames.json` (Homebrew's documented
  # mechanism for third-party tap renames; the in-formula `oldname` /
  # `oldnames` DSL is homebrew-core-only and was rejected at load time
  # by Homebrew 5.x). Replaces the v0.4.0 orphan Formula/tap.rb.
